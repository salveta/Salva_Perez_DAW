Java projects in the current DAW

Here you can find two small projects that i was doing in my Programming Studies spepecialized in Multiplatform development. 

In 'Apuestas' you could find a simple project where you could interactuate with a software about sports betting. You can add
teams, scores, delete dates and save all dates in a data base. The software was made with windowbuilder and have as a backbone 
one combobox. You can interactuate with some windows, too.

'Equipos' is a example part of the project 'Apuestas' where you can connect with the database and some features more.


PD: This repository is only of first course of Programming Studies spepecialized in Multiplatform development.
